The project involves presenting actionable insights through visualizations and addressing business-related questions.

**Objectives**

Analyze business performance: Understand factors driving revenue from both operational and marketing perspectives.
Strategic expansion planning: Identify regions, products, and customer segments contributing to revenue growth for potential expansion.
Demographic insights: Provide metrics that highlight business trends based on available demographic data.
Prepare and present findings: Develop a report and visuals to assist leadership in decision-making.
Tasks and Deliverables
Task 1: Drafting Questions for the CEO and CMO
You are required to draft four relevant questions that align with the perspectives of the CEO and CMO, considering their unique focuses:

What are the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue (excluding the UK), and how does quantity sold correlate with revenue in these regions?
Who are the top 10 revenue-generating customers, and how can marketing efforts retain them?
Task 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
Using Power BI (or Tableau), create visualizations to address the questions drafted for the CEO and CMO. Ensure data is cleaned and visuals are interactive for a compelling presentation.

**Visuals:**
Monthly Revenue Trends (2011):
